# pain27
the pain27 is an open source keyboard project to make an easily usable yet completely and utterly unusable qwerty with all the letters of the english alphabet, a spacebar, and nothing else. supports cherry mx style and smk switches, through hole leds for backlighting, rgb underglow, and only requires a pro micro for programming.
